# My To Do list

Starter project to test [React](https://reactjs.org) skills.

You must use [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html),
as we've discontinued React Class Components.

## Getting started

1. Install and setup both [`git`](https://git-scm.com) and [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.dev/en/) on your machine.
2. Clone the project locally.
3. `cd` in the project directory and run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start` to have it served on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
5. edit files inside the `src` directory, the webapp will be automatically updated on save.

## Code

You should resolve each step of your assignment in a *separate* feature branch.

Open a pull request on **your private repo** for each completed step and assign it to your reviewer.

If you have any problems understanding the assignments, contact your reviewer for more details.

**Very important**: if you don't know any of the technology involved, start doing some research before writing any code.
